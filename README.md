WFAToolbox is a MATLAB App for walk-forward analysis (backtesting) of custom algorithmic trading strategies

# Walk-Forward Analysis
Using only backtesting (in-sample) and out-of-sample testing is not enough to develop robust algorithmic trading strategy. Only walk-forward testing allows you to get real-world solutions.

# Easy-To-Use GUI
The user-friendly interface allows you to do all the steps of trading strategy testing at the click of a button. This makes it accessible even for those who are somewhat familiar with MATLAB.

# Historical Data Sources
You can load intraday and daily historical data for almost every type of assets: stocks, futures, forex, crypto etc. from Alpha Vantage, CoinAPI, IQFeed*, OANDA, MetaTrader 4, Interactive Brokers*.

# MATLAB Language
Using MATLAB language and Toolboxes** (Machine Learning, Econometrics, Neural Network etc.) gives you access to all of the sophisticated models you might need for developing advanced strategy.
